 - There’s a lot of cool information that Spotify offers, but it’s not easily visualized
 - We as a team have created an app that retrieves and visualizes a Spotify user’s data into something interesting, fun, and informative. 
 - To achieve this, we wanted to use GraphQL to pull data and manipulate the endpoints to fit the data we wanted to plot into graphs using D3.
